## Hi there, I'm Aymen! 👋

I'm a computer engineering graduate with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Game Development. Currently, I'm working on my thesis project in the biomedical field, where I'm researching the use of Deep Neural Networks to predict heart diseases from PCG signals.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Programming and Software Development Experience

I have experience in programming and software development in various languages, including C#, Python, Lua, and more. I started my programming journey with Unity and developed games for fun. Later, I developed a heart disease prediction algorithm using logistic regression in Python. I also learned Lua to develop games in Roblox, which got a significant number of plays.

In addition, I pursued a Computer Engineering Masters major, where I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and operating systems. Currently, I'm working on my deep learning PCG classification algorithm, where I'm gaining expertise in PyTorch and deep learning in general.
